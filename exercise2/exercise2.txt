Exercise 2 - Access to the Operating System
===========================================

1. Having managed an exploit for the database, can we get access to the 
   operating system?  Navigate to the DNS Lookup page and use it to look up
   an IP address.  (Note depending on your VM network options you might
   just get an error - this is fine we don't need to use the IP addresses).

   Now, if you look at the output, what can you tell from it?  What is 
   the server side script probably doing?  Can you use this knowledge to
   find the current working directory of the server process?  Can you
   list its content?

2. We now want to see if we can upload files to the web server host.
   Navigate to the "File Upload" page and upload a simple text file.
   What does the application do?  

   Create a simple PHP file (we have supplied one called print-date.php
   to get you started).  Can you upload this?  If you can upload it
   can you get it to execute?

   The file uploader puts the uploaded file in /tmp.  Can you get it
   to put the file elsewhere?  Like in the document root for our site?
