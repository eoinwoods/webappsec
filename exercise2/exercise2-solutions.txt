Exercise 2 Solutions
=====================

1. As you may have discovered the DNS Lookup page is shockingly insecure
   because it blindly passes the field content to the operating system to
   execute.

   Enter "abc ; pwd" into the hostname field and you'll see that nslookup
   runs but so does the "pwd" command.  You can now get easy access to the
   operating system prompt.


2. Again this is not very difficult, the File Upload page will upload anything,
   and doesn't validate files for size or content.  Try uploading our little PHP
   file and it will end up in /tmp.

   If you use the URL http://...../index.php?page=/tmp/print-date.php then you'll
   find that the site blindly executes that PHP snippet.

   Worse still, if you intercept the inbound request you'll find a parameter called
   UPLOAD_DIRECTORY which you can change in BurpSuite.  If you use /var/mutillidae
   for this parameter then the page will end up in the document root of the site.
