Exercise 3 Solutions
====================

You will probably have realised that the key to this attack is to tampler with
the headers being sent to the server as they are not secured in any way.

1. Navigate to the "Add to Your Blog" page and check that your username is shown
   at the top right hand side of the page.  Add an entry.

2. Switch on interception in the BurpSuite Proxy and load the "Add to your Blog"
   page again.  Note that there are cookies for the PHPSESSID, the uid and the
   username.

   If you change the username cookie and resubmit the page, you will see that the
   user (displayed in the page header) doesn't change.  However if you supply 
   another user ID then the user does change.

   You need to extract the user ID from the "accounts" table using an SQL 
   injection attack to make this work.

   The injection text you need is something like:

      ' UNION select null, concat(cid, '=', username), null, null, null, null, null FROM accounts

   Enter this into the "username" field on the User Info page and save the result.
   Use the CID value to impersonate a new user.

3. To post to that user's blog, switch on interception in the proxy and create a 
   blog post.  In BurpSuite, edit the "uid" cookie to be the correct number for
   the user you are interested in (Tim's UID is 18) and then forward on the
   request.

   The blog entry should appear in that user's blog.
