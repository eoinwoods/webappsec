Exercise 3 - Impersonating a User
=================================

For reasons that will become clear later, we would like to be able to post an
entry on someone else's blog (perhaps a senior managers or the system 
administrator's).

We actually found earlier that we can display user passwords, because Mutillidae
is so insecure that it keeps them in cleartext in the database!  However let's 
ignore that for now - there might be good reasons for not wanting to log into 
the site as a user as it might alert people to our devious activities.

1. Log into the site using your user account and navigate to the "Add to Your
   Blog" page.  Enter a new blog post.

2. Switch on interception in BurpSuite and load the page again.  Inspect the
   headers.  Can you impersonate a user without logging in as them?  
   (Hint: you'll need some information from the "accounts" table we extracted
    in Exercise 1)

3. Once you've managed to send a request as a different user, create an entry
   on "tim"s blog.
