Exercise 1 - Scouting the System
=================================

1. Set up Mutillidae and BurpSuite and check that your browser is sending
   requests to the server via BurpSuite.  Intercept some traffic in BurpSuite's
   "Proxy" tab and review your request history.

2. Let's start with a very simple SQL injection attack:
   - Navigate to the "User Info" page
   - Register for a new account
   - Navigate back to the page and enter your username and password to 
     view your account details
   - Use SQL injection on this page to view all of the accounts, not just yours


3. Now we'd like to extend our use of this vulnerability to get some more 
   information than the previous attack.  It would be very useful to us to
   know the user IDs of all of the users.  We can use this later in another
   attack.  Can you extend the SQL injection attack here to display more
   data from the table.  (Hints: the table is "accounts", it has 7 columns
   and one of the columns is called "cid")

4. Changing tack slightly, it would be useful to be able to read some files
   from the operating system.  Navigate to the Text File Viewer page.  Try
   viewing one of the files from the drop down list.

   Now can you use this page to view other files?  It seems to be pulling
   files from textfiles.com  Can it be used to read other URLs?  Can it be 
   used to access files on the host file system?  
   (Hint: several ways of doing this, but you might need to use more than 
          the web browser to achieve this)


So at the end of this exercise we have:
 * Learned how to perform SQL injection and found a workable attack vector
 * Found out how to extract all of the information we need from the user
   accounts table
 * Learned how to access Internet URLs anonymously
 * Learned how to read files on the web server host file system
